Extension_by:	Curaga, Robert Schumann
Comments:	This extension lacks 3D support and runs without Xorg. Steps:

			1. winecfg, let download gecko engine (maybe takes some time)
			2. In winecfg under Graphics uncheck 'Allow window manager to control windows'
			3. wine myapp.exe

		For 3D, printing, scanning, ldap, etc. support use the wine-gl.tcz extension. The winetricks
		extension might be helpful when installing original packages by MS.
	   	--- 
		This extension is PPI compatible.
		This extension uses recursion for dependencies and requires tinycore >= 2.10.
