                FVWM is one of the most flexible and powerful WMs available; but
                that power results in a potentially complex configuration. This is
                not an 'out of the box' window manager, but with some configuration
                it can be very useful in a permament installation.

                NB: Perl is *NOT* included in the .dep file since the core product
                does not require it, however several modules and other ancillary
                programs are supplied as Perl scripts (and will therefore require
                Perl).

                To the best of my understanding this is PPI compatible
