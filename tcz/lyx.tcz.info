Comments:       LyX combines the power and flexibility of TeX/LaTeX with the ease of 
		use of a graphical interface. LyX needs a full TeX distribution to generate 
		DVI,PDF,PS outputs. A full Tex Live installation takes about 2G disk space. 
		So instead of an installation use iso/DVD option. 

		To summarize things to do:
		1) Mount texlive2008.iso (download 1.2G compressed image and decompress)
		2) Run tl-portable (in base directory of iso)(you need perl5 extension)
		3) Run lyx
		4) Tools->Reconfigure then restart LyX to configure tex live installation properly.
		   (This step may not be required if you are running LyX for the first time.)

		Also you can install texlive on a persistent location such as i do
		I have installed texlive on /home/tc/.local/TexLive2008 and added its bin path to ~/.profile

		LyX needs more than Tex Live for full functionality.
		Here are some suggested extensions:
		Image converter --> ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick 		
		Spell checker --> ispell, aspell
		DVI viewer --> xdvi (available with TeX Live)
		PDF viewer --> xpdf, epdfview or gsview
		PS viewer --> gsview
		
		Note: Some conversions depend on gs.tcz and cups.tcz

		For more information see:
		http://www.lyx.org/AdditionalSoftware		

		Note: Installing these programs is not enough usually. You have to specify
		appropriate commands to invoke them in Tools->Preferences inside LyX.
		
		For example you installed GraphicsMagick as image converter
		Go to Tools->Preferences->File Handling->Converters
		add from PNG format to EPS format with command "gm convert $$i $$o"
		For file viewers, Tools->Preferences->File Handling->File formats 
		Choose a file format and enter the name of binary to textbox "Viewer"
 
		Built without native language support(Gui is english only).
		(Anyways nls does not work for some reason)
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
