Comments:       This is a really awesome application that does many 
		different things I think the Core community will benefit 
		from :)

		This is an older version of OSS (v4.0) compiled from source.
		The current version (v4.1) seems to have issues with some 
		audio chipsets notably with the Crystal CS4xxx series.  Use
		this extension only if OSS.tcem doesn't work for you.
-
		The command to start OSS 4.0 is "sudo soundon".
		To test OSS use command "osstest"
-
		The optional GUI mixer depends on GTK2; the 
		command-line mixer, ossmix, works in all systems.
-
		All apps coming with OSS4 included, some of them:
		ossplay		Wave player
		ossrecord	Wave recorder
		ossmix		Console mixer
		ossxmix		GTK2 mixer
		osstest		A sound test
		ossinfo		Displays information about your sound
-
		Detected hardware and saved volume settings are in 
		/usr/lib/oss/etc, so you might want to add that to your 
		backup.
-
		Note: to compile apps that use OSS, no need to have OSS 
		loaded. The header file is in compiletc.
