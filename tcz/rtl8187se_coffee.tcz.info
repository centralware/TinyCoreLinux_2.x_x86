Comments: 	in order to load the kernel modules in the proper order, you may have to 
		run: 
		sudo sh /local/lib/modules/2.6.29.1-tinycore/kernel/driver/net/wireless/wlan0up

		If you add the above line to the file, /opt/bootlocal.sh then the script will run 
		each time you start up. (note, sudo is not required for commands in the 
		bootlocal.sh file)

		You must use wireless_tools.tcz or wicd.tcz (or a similar program) to connect to a 
		wireless network. Be sure to follow the instructions included with those 
		programs.
