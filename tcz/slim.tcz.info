-
		SLiM is a graphical login manager.
-
		To use effectively, add a password for your user, and 
		add /etc/shadow to your backup. If you use another 
		username than "tc", also add /etc/passwd.
-
		sudo passwd tc
		echo "etc/shadow" >> /opt/.filetool.lst
-
		This extension is automagic, ie if it is in your tcz 
		directory along with its dependencies, you will see a 
		graphical login instead of an autologin.
		*warning* this extension overwrites /root/.profile
-
		Starting with TC 2.0, add the bootcode "superuser"
