		Installation Notes

		Python is required but not included as a dependency
		to allow for user version preferences.

		- python.tcz (current ver. 2.6.4) works as is without modification.

		- python-2.5.2.tcz requires a symlink to /usr/local/bin/python which can
		  be created like this:

		  sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python2.5 /usr/local/bin/python

		- python-2.5.2-minimal does not work at the moment.


		Optional Extensions

		pyogg-vorbis.tcz  - required if you want to stream ogg-vorbis files
		tcp-wrappers.tcz - to filter network traffic
		sshfs-fuse-2.2.tcz - to allow access via Secure Shell (SSH)


		Configuration

		Your configuration file is located at: /home/tc/.edna/edna.conf
	
		The only option which must be set prior to use is the location
		of your mp3 directory in the [sources] section. (default not set)

		Other options you may want to change are:

		1. The port number (default 8080)
		2. User and password authentication (default none)
		3. Logging options (default standard out)
		3. Server customization and appearance
	

		Running Edna

		********************* Important ***********************
		Make sure the directory pointed to in your config file
		is mounted and accessible prior to starting edna.
		*******************************************************
		
		1. From the window manager menu:

		 applications -> Edna -> [Start] [Stop] [Restart]

		2. From a terminal:

		sudo edna start
		sudo edna stop
		sudo edna restart
 

		Accessing Your Music
	
		1. From the edna host:

		localhost:8080
		127.0.0.1:8080

		2. From a local network client - enter the LAN address of edna host

		ex. 192.168.0.100:8080

		3. From a remote client - enter your IP address
		
		
		Boot Startup

		To start edna at system boot, add the following line to /opt/bootlocal.sh
		
		/usr/local/bin/edna start
	
		Note: make sure the command to mount your mp3 directory comes beforehand.

		
		Addendum
		
		The configuration template is located at: /usr/local/etc/edna.config
		
		Should you accidentally erase the config file in your home directory 
		and find yourself without a backup copy, simply run:
		
		sudo edna
		
		... and a new one will be created, ready for modification.
