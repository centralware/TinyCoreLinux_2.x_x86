Comments:	Pilot-link is a collection of tools for communication
		with a Palm OS device. Pilot-link supports Linux, OSX,
		and theoretically Windows via Cygwin. Pilot Link is
		used by J-Pilot and other GUI tools. 
		
		Since no major, new products are using Palm OS, version 
		0.12.4 was to be the last official release, and the
		project site is not online all the time (!). 0.12.4
		does not reliably work on Tiny Core 2.7 however (for
		dentonlt, at least - it crashes at random).  

		This version includes significant changes to support  
		libusb-1.0 and Tiny Core 2.7. Tested on TC 2.7 with a 
		Palm Tungsten E.

		This is the development extension. It includes headers,
		binaries other than pilot-xfer, and support files for
		dlpsh and the pilot-link debugger.
