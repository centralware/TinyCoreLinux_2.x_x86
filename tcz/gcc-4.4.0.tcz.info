Comments:       the gnu compiler collection, including the C and C++ compilers
                built using the binutils-2.19.1 and base-devs extensions
                requires the libgmp, libmpfr, ppl and cloog extensions
                Might need the following extensions:
                bison, diffutils, file, findutils, flex, gawk, gperf,
                grep, help2man, m4, make, patch, pkg-config, sed
                ***note***
                tinycore-2.x was not built with this version of gcc..
                ..nor with binutils-2.19.1 - care should be taken when..
                ..compiling for tinycore-2.x with this.
                ***note***
