Comments:       From http://luajit.org/luajit.html:
                
                  LuaJIT implements the full set of language features 
                  defined by Lua 5.1. The virtual machine (VM) is API- 
                  and ABI-compatible to the standard Lua interpreter 
                  and can be deployed as a drop-in replacement.

                  LuaJIT offers more performance, at the expense of 
                  portability. It currently runs on all popular 
                  operating systems based on x86 CPUs (Linux, Windows, 
                  OSX etc.). It will be ported to x64 CPUs and other 
                  platforms in the future, based on user demand and 
                  sponsoring. 

                -----------------------------------------------------

                This extension contains the LuaJIT compiler. See the
                luajit-dev extension for the developmental files from 
                the LuaJIT distribution.

                This is a beta release of the higher-performance 
                version 2 of LuaJIT. 

                This extension was built with the TC-standard compiler
                options "-march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe".  LuaJIT
                is designed for i686 or better, so performance is not 
                optimal.  I have no way to verify that this version 
                actually works on the i486 or i586 architectures.
