Comments:	Works best if you have a panel where you can right click
		on the application icon (e.g. works fine with LXDE).
		
		First time started a GUI shows up that assist in first
		connection with Dropbox.
		Subsequent activations enters daemon mode silently.
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
