Comments:       The latest Inkscape for all your vector needs.
-
		Unless you need some new features, using the much
		smaller Inkscape Lite is recommended.
-
		For some of the extensions and plugins, you need
		both perl and python (in addition to other deps!).
		Latex, GIMP, etc. plugins depend on their respective
		programs.
