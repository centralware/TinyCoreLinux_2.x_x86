Comments:       VLC media player is a highly portable multimedia player supporting most audio 
		and video formats (H.264, Ogg, DivX, MKV, TS, MPEG-2, mp3, MPEG-4, aac, ...) 
		from files, physical media (DVDs, VCD, Audio-CD), TV capture cards and many 
		network streaming protocols.

		This is the latest stable release in Goldeneye branch.
		
		Almost all audio and video codecs (except rare ones), support for matroska, 
		ogg formats available with this build.
		
		Reading from dvd(with menu support),vcd,audio-cd, bd, TV capture cards are enabled. 

		You can have OSS or ALSA for sound, both enabled.

		This build does not depend on Xorg but I recommend it if you want to watch movies
		in full screen (especially hd movies).

		You can switch to and from full screen mode by hotkey "f" or by double clicking on the frame.
		Important thing to note about full screen mode is that a gray window covers whole screen 
		when you switch to full screen mode. You can manually drag and drop it out of screen by 
		using your mouse. This cannot be reproduced with other window managers than flwm.
		
		One of the things you have to do when you first run vlc is to show full path to a valid font
		in Tools->Preferences->Subtitle menu. You can find one in /usr/local/share/vlc/skins2/fonts
		You can also choose the proper character encoding here for your subtitles.

		There are also some suggested options to increase performance while playing hd movies.
		Go to Tools->Preferences, in bottom left corner click on "All" in "Show settings" then
		expand Input/Codecs->Access modules->File, set "Caching value in ms" to 800 ms.
		
		Again in Input/Codecs, expand "Other codecs"->FFmpeg->Decoding->  
		"Skip the loop filter for H.264" , select "All" .

		Skins enabled so have a look at http://www.videolan.org/vlc/skins.php
		and put the ones you like most in the directory ~/.local/share/vlc/skins2
		Go to Tools->Preferences->Interface and choose Skins in Interface Type and restart vlc.
		vlc will start in default skin. If you want to change skin right click on somewhere near
		vlc buttons then Interface->Select skin (if you put your skin files in the directory given 
		above, your skin files should appear here). If you put your skin file in a different directory
		you can show full path to it
		Tools->Preferences->Interface->Interface Type->Skins menu.
		
		Note: For video4Linux2 support you need to load libv4l extension
		Note: For encrypted dvd support you need to install libdvdcss

		Optional dependencies: Xorg, SDL(+graphics-libs-1), libmtp, libv4l
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
