Extension_by:   Curaga
Comments:       Memory Technology Device support. Commonly used for 
		flash chips without a chip in between (ie not for usb 
		sticks). Can also be used to use otherwise unaccessible 
		ram for storage or swap (ever wondered why your graphics 
		card needs 2gb? it doesn't, use a part of it for swap :)

		This extension is PPI compatible.
