Comments:       This is for old NVIDIA cards and depends on Xorg.  It works
		for my geforce 4 mx 440. If /etc/X11/xorg.conf does not exist it
		will be created for you. If you already have an xorg.conf you
		can edit it manually or run "sudo nvidia-xconfig" to generate
		nvidia driver entries.  This extension will also add
		etc/X11/xorg.conf to /opt/.filetool.lst if there is not already
		a line containing xorg.conf.  In addition it will add the line
		pointing to the tls directory to /etc/ld.so.conf and add
		/etc/ld.so.conf to /opt/.filetool.lst.
