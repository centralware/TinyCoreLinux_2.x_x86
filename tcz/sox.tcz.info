Comments:       The Swiss Army knife of sound processing programs.
                SoX can apply many effects to conversion or playback,
                which is what differentiates it from most other audio
                utilities. Use the sox --help command or consult
                http://sox.sourceforge.net/sox.html for usage.
                This executable was compiled on TC 2.4.1 to support
                vorbis, mp3, and flac formats as well as wav files.
                In addition to the dependencies, you will need OSS or
                alsa installed to use sox for playback or recording.
