Comments:       Mike L. compiled the rt2860 module for use on an eeePC 1000
                ----------
                Requires the wireless-2.6.29.1-tinycore and wireless_tools extensions
                ----------
				After booting, you should see a network interface "raN" 
				with N being 0 in most cases: ra0.  To associate with a 
				wireless access point, you can set up a simple script like 
				the following:
				
				    #!/bin/sh
				    # commands to associate with wireless access point
				    sudo /sbin/ifconfig ra0 up
				    sudo /usr/local/sbin/iwconfig ra0 essid "{{{YOUR ESSID HERE}}}" key restricted "{{{YOUR KEY HERE}}}"
				    sleep 2
				    sudo /sbin/udhcpc -i ra0
				
				This could be called manually after booting, or automatically
				from /opt/bootlocal.sh.  Note that if the preceding commands 
				are directly inserted in bootlocal.sh, you don't need the "sudo"
				prefixes.  
				
				Altenatively, you may use a series of iwpriv commands:
					#!/bin/sh
					#Config STA to link with AP which is OPEN/NONE(Authentication/Encryption))
					iwpriv ra0 set NetworkType=Infra
					iwpriv ra0 set AuthMode=OPEN
					iwpriv ra0 set EncrypType=NONE
					iwpriv ra0 set SSID="AP's SSID" 
					
				Another example of iwpriv:
					#!/bin/sh
					#Config STA to link with AP which is OPEN/NONE(Authentication/Encryption))
					iwpriv ra0 set NetworkType=Infra
					iwpriv ra0 set AuthMode=WPAPSK
					iwpriv ra0 set EncrypType=AES
					iwpriv ra0 set SSID="AP's SSID"
					iwpriv ra0 set WPAPSK="AP's wpa-preshared key"
					iwpriv ra0 set SSID="AP's SSID"				
				
				The file 'iwpriv_usage.txt' in the driver source code has 
				more examples and descriptions of all the control options.
				
				A third method that might work is to edit the hardware 
				configuration file /etc/RT2860STA/RT2860STA.dat that is read
				when the driver kernel module is loaded.  If you try this, 
				please make a backup in a persistant location, and also add 
					etc/RT2860STA
				To your /opt/.filetool.lst.
