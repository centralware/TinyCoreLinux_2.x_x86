Comments:       This is for older NVIDIA cards and depends on Xorg.  It works
		for my 5700. If /etc/X11/xorg.conf does not exist it will be
		created for you. If you already have an xorg.conf you can edit
		it manually or run "sudo nvidia-xconfig" to generate nvidia
		driver entries.  This extension will also add etc/X11/xorg.conf
		to /opt/.filetool.lst if there is notalready a line containing
		xorg.conf
