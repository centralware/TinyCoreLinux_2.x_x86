Comments:       This software contains a Linux kernel driver for 
                Atheros-based Wireless LAN devices.  The driver 
                supports station, AP, ad-hoc, and monitor modes 
                of operation.  The Atheros driver depends on a 
                device-independent implementation of the 802.11 
                protocols that originated in the BSD community 
                (NetBSD in particular).  
                
                The driver functions as a normal network device 
                and uses the Wireless Extensions API.  As such 
                normal Linux tools can and should be used with 
                it.  Where the wireless extensions are lacking 
                private ioctls have been added.
