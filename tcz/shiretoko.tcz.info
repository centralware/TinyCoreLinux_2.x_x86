Comments:       This is a custom build of Firefox, i686 optimized.
                Depends on gtk2 and it's deps.  This extension
		conflicts with Minefield but not the official Firefox 
		extension.  This is a fairly basic build with less
		dependencies than the official Firefox.  The maximum 
		cacne size is 20MB and the urlclassifier is disabled.
                This extension is PPI compatible.
