Title:          gtkpod-lite.tcz (TESTING v0.99.14)
Description:    gtkpod is an iPod interface & library manager for Linux 
Version:        0.99.14
Author:         Schuler, Donohoe, Ulrich, et al
Original-site:  http://www.gtkpod.org/ 
Copying-policy: GPL2 
Size:		1.1M
Extension_by:   juanito, dentonlt
Comments:       This is a minimal-build version of gtkpod. This build does -not-
		include support for ogg, flac, m4a/acc, or gnome-vfs. Locale data
		is also removed. The regular "gtkpod" extension is a feature-full 
		gtkpod build, but requires 5-10mb in dependent libraries.
		
		The gtkpod-lite and gtkpod extensions are not compatible. Not a
		good idea to install both.

		Gtkpod is a GTK interface for manipulating your iPod contents.
                Mount your iPod at /mnt/ipod, or change the iPod mount point in
                gtkpod.
              
              	Classic and Nano iPods will need a change to the iPod's SysInfo
              	file - visit http://www.gtkpod.org/libgpod/ and follow the link
              	to README.SysInfo.
              	
                Requires:
                gtk2, libglade, libarte, libgnomecanvas, libgpod, libid3tag
