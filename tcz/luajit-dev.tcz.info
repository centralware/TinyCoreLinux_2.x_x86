                  LuaJIT implements the full set of language features 
                  defined by Lua 5.1. The virtual machine (VM) is API- 
                  and ABI-compatible to the standard Lua interpreter 
                  and can be deployed as a drop-in replacement.

                  LuaJIT offers more performance, at the expense of 
                  portability. It currently runs on all popular 
                  operating systems based on x86 CPUs (Linux, Windows, 
                  OSX etc.). It will be ported to x64 CPUs and other 
                  platforms in the future, based on user demand and 
                  sponsoring. 

                -----------------------------------------------------

                This extension contains the developmental files from
                the LuaJIT distribution.  See the luajit extension
                for the compiler.

                These files are needed if the comparable ones from 
                the lua extension are are not installed or if you 
                wish to link against the LuaJIT libraries.
