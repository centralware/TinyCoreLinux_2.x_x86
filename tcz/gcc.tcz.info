                ----------
                Note: for ease of use, you can use the compiletc meta extension to load gcc and
                all the commonly required apps to have a complete compile environment for microcore/tinycore.
                Of course if you want to do things differently, that's OK too.
                ----------
                requires the gcc_libs extension
                Usually requires the binutils and base-devs extensions
                Might need the following extensions:
                bison, diffutils, file, findutils, flex, gawk, gperf,
                grep, help2man, m4, make, patch, pkg-config, sed
                ----------
                This extension contains:
                gcc-4.2.2 - GPLv2 - http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.2.2/gcc-4.2.2.tar.bz2
                ----------
