Comments:	Pilot-link is a collection of tools for communication
		with a Palm OS device. Pilot-link supports Linux, OSX,
		and theoretically Windows via Cygwin. Pilot Link is
		used by J-Pilot and other GUI tools. 
		
		Since no major, new products are using Palm OS, version 
		0.12.4 was to be the last official release, and the
		project site is not online all the time (!). 0.12.4
		does not reliably work on Tiny Core 2.7 however (for
		dentonlt, at least - it crashes at random).  

		This extension includes significant changes to support  
		libusb-1.0 and Tiny Core 2.7. Tested on TC 2.7 with a 
		Palm Tungsten E.

		Use "pilot-xfer" from the CLI to interact with your  
		handheld. Example for 'list':

			pilot-xfer -p usb: -l -t 5

		For help, see the online man pages or use pilot-xfer 
		without arguments. 

		This is the base extension. It includes libraries,
		the pilot-xfer binary, and source file for libusb.c.
		Headers and other binaries are in the dev extension.
