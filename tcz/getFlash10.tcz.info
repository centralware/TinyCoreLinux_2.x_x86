                Extracts linux libflashplayer.so
                Setup libflashplayer for either Minefield, Firefox, Opera, 
		Seamonkey or all four. Also includes compiled libflashsupport.so 
		for OSS sound. libflashsupport is licensed under Creative 
		Commons Attribution 3.0.
                Finally packages a flash10.tcz to add to your tcz collection.
.
                NOTE: You must have already downloaded the browser and OSS.
                You must have started the browser at least once!
                You must have OSS started with the sound on menu option.
                Then select getFlash10 from the Apps menu.
.
                If you already have your tce directory setup, then a flash10.tcz
                will be installed there, otherwise it is in /tmp/tce/.  flash10.tcz
		will be loaded upon completion of the getflash script.
.
                CAUTION: Flash10 requires gtk2 which is quite large.
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
