Comments:	In the X Window System, an X display manager runs 
		as a program, that allows the starting of a session 
		on an X server from the same or another computer.
		A display manager presents the user with a login 
		screen which prompts for a username and password. 
		A session starts when the user successfully enters 
		a valid combination of username and password.
