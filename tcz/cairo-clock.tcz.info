Comments:      	This extension requires Xorg with enabled Composite extension
		and a compositing window manager.

		Currently we have only xfwm4 as a compositing window manager.

		So xfce4 is recommended.

		Also in xfce4 enable compositing from
		settings->window manager tweaks->compositor->enable display compositing

		This extension is PPI compatible.
