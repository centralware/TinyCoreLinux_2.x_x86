Comments:       Tool to modify the video BIOS of the 800 and 900 series Intel
                graphics chipsets. This includes the 830, 845G, 855G, and 865G
                chipsets, as well as 915G, 915GM, 945G, 946GZ, G965, and Q965
                chipsets. This modification may be necessary to display certain
                graphics resolutions with an X server, and especially with the
                default XVesa that ships with Tiny Core Linux.

                Note that modifications to the video BIOS are transient, not
                permanent. So, you need to set the configuration every time you
                start the machine (and before you start up the X server).
                Obvious place to invoke 915resolution in Tiny Core Linux is thus
                from /opt/bootlocal.sh

                Usage: /usr/local/sbin/915resolution [-l] [Mode# X Y] [depth]
                Use the -l flag to get the list of modes and resolution from the
                video bios. And use without -l flag to modify one mode with new
                resolution and optionally new bits/pixel depth.
