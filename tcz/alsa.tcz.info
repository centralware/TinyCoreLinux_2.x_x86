                ----------
                This extension contains:
                alsa-lib-1.0.20 - GPLv2.1 - ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/lib/alsa-lib-1.0.20.tar.bz2
                alsa-utils-1.0.20 - GPLv2 - ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/utils/alsa-utils-1.0.20.tar.bz2
                ----------
                Example howto:
                $ sudo alsaconf
                $ speaker-test
                ----------
		To initialize alsa without having to use alsaconf, there is a
		script that will do that.  
		It can be placed in /opt/bootlocal.sh so it alsa will be setup 
		on boot with no user interaction required.  The command to do this is:

		/usr/local/etc/init.d/alsasound start

		If adding this command to bootlocal.sh, you may need
		to precede it with the sleep command for it to be effective.

		If you want your alsa settings to persist across reboots, use the 
		command 'alsactl store' after alsa has been set up.  This stores the 
		configuration in /etc/asound.state.  Place this file in your backup to 
		allow your alsa settings to persist across sessions.
