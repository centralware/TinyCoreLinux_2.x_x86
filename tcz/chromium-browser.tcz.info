Comments:       dejavu-fonts-ttf.tcz is recommended.  

		For Freedesktop users only:
		-xdg-utils.tcz is recommend. (This is needed to detect and launch preferred applications.)

		-Remember chromium for linux is still in beta stage. So it has known
		issues. For example there are reported flashplayer crashes.

		-Also note that this is not Google Chrome. This is Chromium, the open
		source project behind Google Chrome. Chrome is the official build of
		Google. To see the differences between Chromium and Chrome:

		-One of the best features of Chromium is the extensions. Extensions
		can be reached from the main menu. Note that some extensions are 
		not yet supported on linux.

		-The other nice feature is the themes. You can download and install themes or
		even create yourself. Options->Personal Stuff->Appearance click "Get themes"

		This is built from source for i686.
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
