Comments:	by default the policy is to deny everything unless a specific config
		file exists in /usr/local/etc/pam.d directory

		#example pam config of an application can be:
		auth 	  include   system-auth
		account   include   system-auth
		password  include   system-auth
		session   include   system-auth

		see man pages in Linux-PAM-doc for details.

		Note: If you are building a pam module or building an application with pam authentication enabled
		please make sure the files go in to correct directories given as follows
			modules dir: /usr/local/lib/security
			config dir: /usr/local/etc/pam.d

		This extension is PPI compatible.
