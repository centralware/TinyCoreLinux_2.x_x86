Comments:	The Guest Additions add functionality to guest OSes with
		seamless integration of display and mouse.
		A compatible xorg.conf will be placed in /etc/X11.
		Using the predescribed bootcode "kmap=" will cause xorg.conf
		to have the desired keymap.

		started from the menu OR automate  by adding the line
		"VBoxClient-all" to ~/.xsession.
		Xorg must be restarted for these work.

		VBox-OSE-additions-modules-2.6.29.1-tinycore.tcz
