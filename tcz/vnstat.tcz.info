Comments:       console-based network traffic monitor that keeps a log 
		of network traffic for the selected interface(s). It 
		uses the network interface statistics provided by the 
		kernel as information source. This means that vnStat 
		won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures 
		light use of system resources. 
		------
		How to: 	
		in order to make it work and update regularly, follow 
		these steps: 
		
		1. create a vnstat.conf file and copy it to /etc
		2. make a directory in order to save your database 
		file in /var: 
		
		sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/vnstat
		3. i personally symlink the database file: 
		
		ln -s /mnt/yourdevice /var/lib/vnstat
		
		but feel free to make an entry to .filetool.list to make 
		it persist over boots
		4. use the deamon vnstatd in order to update the 
		database regularly, and run it with the -d option 
		(crontab should also work; it didn't work for me):
		
		vnstatd --config /etc/vnstat.conf -d
		
		5. update the database with indication of the device 
		and the config file:
		
		sudo vnstat -u -i eth0 --force --config /etc/vnstat.conf
		
		or (for ppp connection and 3g usb modem)
		
		sudo vnstat -u -i ppp0 --force /etc/vnstat.conf
		
		--foce is used since we work in ram mode.
		6. once the database built for your(s) device(s), call 
		vnstat as user; example for a daily output:
		
		vnstat -d
