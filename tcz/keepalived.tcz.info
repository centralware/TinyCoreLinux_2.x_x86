Comments:       Depends on ipvs-2.6.29.1-tinycore.
                iptables is optional and is required for certain failover setups.

                This extension is PPI Compatible.
                Just add /usr/local/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf into your /opt/.filetool.lst

                Keepalived is a userspace daemon for LVS cluster nodes healthchecks and 
                LVS directors failover. Layer 4 load balancing is included via ipvs kernel module.

                It adds strong & robust keepalive facility to the Linux Virtual Server 
                project by implementing a framework based on three family checks : 
                Layer3, Layer4 & Layer5/7. 

                When one of the server of the LVS server pool is down, keepalived informs the 
                linux kernel via a setsockopt call to remove this server entrie from the LVS topology. 

                In addition keepalived implements an independent VRRPv2 stack to handle director 
                failover.
