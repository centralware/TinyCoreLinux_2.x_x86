Comments:       A gtk2 application for manipulating the contents of your iPod
                Mount your iPod at /mnt/ipod, or change the iPod mount point in
                gtkpod.
              
              	Classic and Nano iPods will need a change to the iPod's SysInfo
              	file - visit http://www.gtkpod.org/libgpod/ and follow the link
              	to README.SysInfo.
              	
                Requires:
                gtk2, libglade, libarte, libgnomecanvas, libgpod, libid3tag,
                and more.

		Building:
	        1) see/get the build-gtkpod script in the TC Forums
	        2) gtkpod's src/mp4file.c code does not agree with mp4v2 1.9.1. 
	        A patched version is included with this extension, as:
	        /usr/local/share/gtkpod/mp4file.c 
	        3) unzip the source code, replace the stock mp4file.c file, then
	        build. See the build script for suggested arguments.
