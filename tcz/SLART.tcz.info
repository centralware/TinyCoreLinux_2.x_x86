Comments:	SvOlli's Little Audio Related Thingies, or SLART for short, is
		a compilation of rather simple programs that are related to
		audio files: it consists of a player (Partyman), a CD ripper, a
		tag editor, a downloader for music files, and some other tools.
		These programs can communicate with each other via UDP, so a
		newly ripped track can be automatically queued in the player,
		for example.
		The audio player depends on dermixd. Install either
		dermixd-alsa or dermix-oss.
